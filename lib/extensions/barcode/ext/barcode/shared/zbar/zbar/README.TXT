We very sorry, but we are removed ZBar source code from our project by ZBar license requirements.
For build Barcode extension for WM, you should download ZBar sources from
http://zbar.sourceforge.net/
and copy to this folder "include" and "zbar" folders from ZBar sources.
Also you should fix ZBar sources for building by Microsoft Visual Studio (move define of inner function variables to begin of functions, etc.)
