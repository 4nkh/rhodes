It is also designed to work with synced local data using a local database such as SQLite or HSQLDB and a generic backend synchronization framework such as RhoSync, another open source component available from Rhomobile. Rhodes is available for iPhone, Research in Motion (Blackberry), Windows Mobile,  and Android phones.
